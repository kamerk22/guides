## Docker

Docker uses containers to build, ship and run your application anywhere. Containers are like a wrapper for developers to pack all the necessary dependencies. In fact, containers isolate your application and provide operating-system-level virtualization. They are lightweight and efficient yet very simple! 

## Advantages

- Very simple for application orchestration.
- Ideal for a microservices application.
- Painless deployments.
- Continuous integration and testing.
- Multi-cloud platform.
